# Project Name

Building (coding?) a webpage

## The problem

I do not do well with video so I watch some of them, read the material that was text and used w3schools. If I had more time I would have watched all the videos and then googled the content to get it in text.

Have you deployed your project somewhere? Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
